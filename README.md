Video call to your friend without registering. 
Simply send your friend your auto-generated unique ID to make the call.  
Everytime you open a new tab, the server gives you a totally different unique ID.

**Development**

```
# Running server
yarn watch:server

# Running webpack-dev-server
yarn watch:client
```
